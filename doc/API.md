# API (Python backend)

## Overview
- Summarize the API purpose and the relationship between the Python backend and the JavaScript UI.
- Define the base URL for local development and staging once available.

## Tech stack
- Record the chosen Python framework and key libraries (e.g., FastAPI/Flask, ORM, auth).

## Authentication and authorization
- Specify auth approach (headers, tokens, session) and required scopes/roles.

## Endpoints
| Path | Method | Description | Request shape | Response shape | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| _TBD_ |  |  |  |  |  |

## Data models
- Define request/response schemas, validation rules, and serialization conventions. Keep examples aligned with the UI needs.

## Errors
- Standardize error formats, status codes, and retry guidance. Document how errors propagate to the UI.

## Versioning and compatibility
- Note the versioning scheme and deprecation policy. Keep backward compatibility considerations documented.

## Testing and observability
- Outline API testing strategy (unit, contract, integration) and logging/metrics/tracing expectations.

## Changelog
- Track notable API changes and link them to the relevant specs and DAT updates.
