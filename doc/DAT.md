# Domain, Assumptions, and Terminology (DAT)

## Purpose
- Outline the problem this framework solves and the value it delivers. Update once scope and users are confirmed.

## Domain terminology
- Define key terms, entities, and relationships. Keep concise and consistent with the API contracts.

## Data sources and ownership
- List data sources, owners, and access patterns (read/write). Note any permissions or privacy constraints.

## Data flows
- Describe request/response flows between the JavaScript UI and Python API, plus any background jobs or pipelines.

## Constraints and assumptions
- Track constraints (performance, security, compliance) and current working assumptions. Revise as they change.

## Open questions
- [ ] Capture unanswered questions and decisions needed before implementation proceeds.
